/**
 * Where a suspended user or admin lands (`/account-suspended`, see `lib/suspension.ts`).
 *
 * The account is blocked, so this is a dead end by design: who was suspended, why, what to do
 * next, and the support address. There is no way back into the app from here.
 *
 * The reason is API-supplied — it comes from the backend's suspension 403, captured by the
 * axios interceptor. There is deliberately **no fetch on this page**: that same 403 clears the
 * auth cookies server-side, so any call made from here would just 401. Only NEXT_STEPS and
 * `SUPPORT.EMAIL` are hard-coded copy.
 *
 * The whole card is sized to fit one screen without scrolling: it's a single message, and a
 * blocked user shouldn't have to scroll to find the address they need. Anything added here has
 * to earn its height — keep the type scale and the gaps as tight as they are.
